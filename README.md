<h1>A data mining and analytics project uncovering user navigation patterns on eCommerce platforms using clustering, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining techniques.

---
## Overview
Understanding user behavior is essential for optimizing customer experience and improving conversions in eCommerce.  
This project analyzes over **100K user activity records** to identify behavioral patterns like browsing, cart additions, and purchases — providing data-driven insights to improve product recommendations and user engagement.
### Key Results  
- The largest user action is viewing products (~24,377 events), with much lower counts for cart additions (~798) and purchases (~1,431) — indicating significant drop-off in the funnel.  
- Clustering segmented users into at least two meaningful groups: one with high browsing/cart but low purchase, and another with strong purchase behavior.  
- Association rule mining uncovered rules such as “Notebook → Mouse”, enabling cross-sell strategies.  
- The user journey sequence (view → cart → purchase) shows where users drop off, highlighting potential UX improvement points.  
- With a silhouette score in the 0.5-0.7 range, the clusters are well defined and can be used for targeted recommendations and marketing.
